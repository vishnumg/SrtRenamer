SrtRenamer
==========

Renames all the srt files to match the filename of the vids in the selected folder.


I was watching this awesome comedy TV series. I managed to download the matching subs but the filenames didnt match. The srt files wer named to be used with another version of the series shared in the torrents. So, I created this app. It renames all the srt files in the selected folder to match with the filenames of the videos.
